# What inspired us to do this project

Amidst this terrific timespan, we tend to have seen every worst scenarios of life, we could have possibly ever imagined. In this outbreak of corona virus many such incidences have taken place where many people have lost their jobs, place, and the basic sources of sustainability.
Which definitely, degraded the quality of their lives in every forms. I myself have witnessed this situation in my neighborhood. My neighbour was a single parent, after her marriage she had completely engrossed herself in the household so after when her husband died, she decided to independently raise her both the kids. For that she worked at various places to fulfill the pressing needs of her family and somehow managed. But after when this outbreak struck, She lost all of her jobs and the condition went too distressing everyday. After this scenario, I felt if something amidst this could help her. So We came up with a idea which shall eventually encourage and help women to work independently and help earn them a living and flourish in life on her own terms. 
## The Problem
'Research shows that even Women when employed, show progress in career that is extremely slow, and at most times, at a state of permanent stasis.’

## Our App & Solution
“In today's world, employment is the key to an individual to stand on their own legs.”

For the users, who have degrees strolling with dust into their cupboards with none recognition of their skills, we here, have got you covered where your skills comes into play with the right value of it which follows. Where the general statics, shows that the women are tend to be paid less irrespective of the same hardwork and expertise. Here we help you freelance and let you demand the right value for your work without of much hassle. We here, would be providing workshops for users, who have zero idea about the career opportunities which they otherwise could have explored, empowering them to become independent and to proceed in accordance to their own terms. This way, we indirectly support them by providing an opportunity to work in a fair environment.

# App Features

An employer searches for a potential employee here, who are sorted on the basis of different professions and are ranked by previous employers. If the profile suits the employer, he will contact her for work. Sometimes, self care is not just a vacation in a tropical island, but also working on oneself and breaking their limits, that's why We also provide career counselling and workshops for women to increase geir networking and knowledge to improve their career.

## Learning Achievements

In all this process, we exceptionally learned about the teamwork skills and the coordination required, in order to complete a task. In the procedure, we learned about App development/figma  and it's immense usability everywhere. Later, to agree over a alike plan in the heap of baffled ideas of everyone.
And lastly to keep calm even at times when it felt the most coerce of correct ideas and deadlines.We learned better tactics of collaboration and market reveniew model. We also learned a lot of facts about women empowerment and various fields that we were unaware of. We learned about the problems women face with their career, workplce and as an employee in an organization  and what solutions we can come up with.

## Challenges

Since it was the very first time for us, participating in hackathon, We didn't have much of experience. Many of us were completely unaware of all the new  terms that we came across during this span. We had to sit down for hours spending most of our time in understanding and learning the App development.  We were constantly having meetings and discussing every curve of our ideas. Due to the limited timespan, our brains were wrenched to come up with a solid plan and work out efficiently with our team at the same time.Being in different time zones was troublesome due to being 12 hours apart. We also had to spend quite some time brainstorming ideas because of the limits.

## Accomplishment

We were highly moved, with the idea of introducing a platform where more of the focus was clearly over the skills and experiences and not based on gender roles. Where it encourages you to come up with your ideas and freelance with the users and get the correct value for your work straightaway from the user without any mediator involved. With that we ask the user to pay a reasonable amount of $20 every month, in return they can earn as much as they can based on their own potential, after using a trial version of the app which shall help them incorporate accordingly to the features and also help them get absorbed to it's usability.
